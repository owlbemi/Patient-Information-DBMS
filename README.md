# Patient-Information-DBMS
## Introduction
This project serves as a brief interpretation of the Patient Information Database Management System, a project designed to explore the fundamentals of database design and management. The system offers a platform for managing patient information within a healthcare setting, ensuring data integrity, scalability, and efficient data retrieval.

## System Requirements
The system caters to various user groups within the healthcare domain, including healthcare providers, insurance companies, and patients. Users can leverage the system to:

- Access and manage their profiles.
- Search for patients, doctors, and appointments based on specific criteria.
- Generate reports on patient demographics and general overviews of doctors or appointments.
- The system prioritizes data security and employs a single main page for user interaction, streamlining the user experience.

## Conceptual Design of the Database
The conceptual design establishes a foundation for the database, outlining the entities, attributes, and relationships between them. An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) visually depicts these elements, providing a clear understanding of the data structure.

## Logical Database Schema
The logical database schema translates the conceptual design into a more technical representation. It utilizes SQL commands to create tables within the database, defining data types, constraints, and primary/foreign keys to ensure data integrity and enforce relationships between tables.

## Functional Dependencies and Database Normalization
Functional dependencies identify relationships between attributes within a table. Database normalization is a process that minimizes data redundancy and improves data integrity. This project adheres to normalization principles to optimize the database structure.

## The Database System
The database system resides on a local server accessible through a web interface. Users can interact with the system using a web browser to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the data.

## Suggestions on Database Tuning
The document explores recommendations for enhancing database security and performance. These suggestions include implementing parameterized queries, stored procedures, and user input validation to safeguard against SQL injection attacks.

## User Application Interface
The user interface provides a user-friendly platform for interacting with the database system. It employs HTML forms to facilitate CRUD operations and data retrieval. The interface prioritizes ease of use and streamlines the user experience.

## Requirements
- XAMPP (Apache Server)
- mySQL and mySQLLite for .php file configuration
- Website (.html) was built on [Replit](Replit.com)
